                                  <p class="project_desc">This article focuses on the theme of reconstituted sight in Spanish films made at the end of the Franco dictatorship and under the subsequent democratic period as they echo the famous opening scene in Un chien andalou (1929) where Luis BuÃ±uel sliced the eye of a woman with a razor. It revisits The Spirit of the Beehive (El espÃ­ritu de la colmena, Erice, 1973) and Raise Ravens (CrÃ­a cuervos, Saura, 1976) through the eyes of its two main characters named Ana and how they process the trauma of the violence removed from their sight through imagination and playacting. The Ana's imagined relationship to violence in both films will be extrapolated to horror films from the democratic period that deal with the defiance of sight in a direct way, Bigas Luna's Anguish (1987) and Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's Thesis (Tesis, 1996). What we could not see in the first two films (both a circumvention of and commentary on Francoist censorship) becomes hypervisible in these films, signaling a resistance to looking away and a determination to confront and vanquish the trauma of Spain's brutal past.

                                  <p class="project_desc">This article engages in a close reading of Carlos Sauraâ€™s understudied La madriguera (1969) by exposing in its use of spatial and material configurations a hermetically sealed Spain under Francoism during the â€˜aperturaâ€™ period of the 1960s. It seeks to elucidate how Sauraâ€™s use of claustrophobic space suggests an unveiling of the process of abstraction embedded in the mechanisms of censorship as they affect the Spanish spectator of the 1960s who sits immobilized in the dark theater, unconsciously juxtaposed to the unassuming agoraphobia foregrounded in the film through its protagonistsâ€™ self-imposed hermetism. The film unveils these mechanisms through a metafilmic language by self-reflecting in its domestic fortress, in its theater of its protagonists Teresa and Pedro constantly performing roles of a time out of joint, recollections of childhood and virtual fantasies that have no place in the present.</p>

                                  <p class="project_desc">When Miguel de Cervantes began writing El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha (1605/1615), he set out to write a satirical, self-reflexive spin on the chivalric romance popularized by the success of AmadÃ­s de Gaula, an early modern Spain bestseller initially published in 1508 that went on to span twelve sequels throughout the sixteenth century. Although history and academia eventually judged Don Quijote as not only the wellspring of the modern novel but also the canonical text for narrative fiction, early modern Spanish culture saw its publication as merely a satire of these â€˜libros de caballerÃ­a.â€™  The exercise of mocking yet elevating this popular form of low-brow fiction with perspicacity brings to mind a string of metafictional films released during the 1990s that produced a revival of the slasher horror genre by cleverly mocking and revitalizing its conventions. Through a close reading of how Quixotic techniques are echoed by contemporary filmmaker Wes Craven in his reinvention of the horror genre with films such as Wes Cravenâ€™s New Nightmare (1994) and the Scream series (1996-2011), this article asks the question: what does Don Quijoteâ€™s self-reflexive narrative devices teach us about not only the significance of horror films in recent times but also the possible academic afterlife of this culturally dismissed genre of teenage popular entertainment?  If Cervantesâ€™ metafictional chivalric romance gave birth to the Modern novel, a genre that spanned four hundred years of influential literature, what kind of genre transformations might Wes Cravenâ€™s metafilmic horror films give birth to? What is the connection of the horror genre in its metafilmic turn and Cervantesâ€™ novel?</p>

That realization about the Churchâ€™s hypocrisy in a way determined the course of his artistic life â€“ a series of trans-cultural endeavors that would take him from his native Spain where he was part of â€œLa generaciÃ³n del 27â€ to France where he joined the Surrealist movement, across the Atlantic to failed attempts at a career in Hollywood and where he briefly worked for the Museum of Modern Art in New York, then south of the border to Mexico where he found a filmmaking niche and finally to international success with films marred in controversy but subsequently lauded with acclaim. From the emblematic surrealist short Un chien andalou (An Andalusian Dog 1929) to the Academy Award winning Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie (The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie 1972), BuÃ±uel experimented in every genre imaginable, from documentary to the musical, but all his films bore his distinct style and themes. They are all unmistakably BuÃ±uelian â€“ a combination of a rebellious assault on religious and aristocratic institutions, a rejection of intellectual reason, and an embrace of the irrationality of dreams as a way to combat the imprisonment of structures both moral and social.</p>

                                      <p class="project_desc">Twin Peaks is a reflection of the effects of consuming television on its spectators, specifically the soap operaâ€™s trivialization and commodification of emotion as currency and the police proceduralâ€™s mouse trap mystery that hook, line and sinkers the viewer. One mode is associated with the feminine, while the other is generally viewed as masculine. In conflating these two narrative drugs, the soap opera and the procedural, the show not only merges the typically divisive engendered audience, but also reveals the mechanisms upon which these capitalist addictions operate. Lynchâ€™s redeployment of the denigrated soap opera in his avant-garde television show is more than just an exercise of taking a lowbrow form of pop culture and turning it on its head with great success. Its many layers are complex, dual in nature and reflective of its spectatorsâ€™ own serial compulsion. </p>

                                      <p class="project_desc">On March 11 1988, a year before the fall of communism in Poland, Krzysztof KieÅ›lowski released an extended version of the fifth chapter of his Decalogue TV series, the one corresponding to the commandment â€˜Thou shall not kill,â€™ entitled Short Film About Killing. As much a political statement against the death penalty as it is a powerful aesthetic cinematic experience, the film opened amidst heated debate over capital punishment in Poland and was initially rejected by Polish audiences who reacted negatively to its juxtaposition of capital punishment with murder. The last execution in Poland was carried out on April 22, one month and eleven days after the film hit theaters in the Eastern European nation. Even though capital punishment remained in Polish law another ten years, no executions were carried out after that one. This paper seeks to explore the role of KieÅ›lowskiâ€™s film not only in deterring further executions in Poland â€“ showing how literature and art can effect political transformation â€“ but also to unmask the spectacle of state-sanctioned executions as a mirror to the senselessness of the murders it claims to punish. Deploying Derridaâ€™s deconstructive rhetoric in Death Penalty Volume I, we will engage in a close reading of the audio-visual techniques KieÅ›lowski employs in his condemnation of Polandâ€™s capital punishment and how they question the validity of state-sanctioned executions in the spectatorâ€™s absorption of the narrative.</p>

                                      <p class="project_desc">In "Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International," Jacques Derrida uses the figure of the ghost of Hamletâ€™s father to express what he coins the â€˜visor effect,â€™ that is â€œthe power to see without being seenâ€ (Derrida 8). Taking the terms â€˜visor effectâ€™ and â€˜spectrality effectâ€™ and applying them to the medium of film, this paper seeks to theorize the presence of the spectator as an invisible specter looking through a raised visor, not of an anachronistic armor but of the lens of a camera, unto a fictional vision of another time, perhaps a representation of the past or that of an imagined future, or, in Shakespearian terms, â€˜a time out of jointâ€™. That which we, as spectators of cinema, witness through the visor of the film screen is a nonexistent time that coalesces with the present spectrally, like the projection of a magic lantern to simulate a ghostly apparition, whether it be the return of the dead or an augur of whatâ€™s to come. Exploring the interplay of the spectral gaze through instances where films seem to be aware of that presence within the visor, that specter under the helmet, that viewer on the other side of the screen, we will look closely at key scenes from Krzysztof KieÅ›lowskiâ€™s "La double vie de VÃ©ronique" and "Trois Couleurs: Rouge," David Lynchâ€™s "Lost Highway," Pedro AlmodÃ³varâ€™s "Los abrazos rotos," and Spike Jonzeâ€™s "Being John Malkovich." Referring at times to interviews with the filmmakers as well as critical work on the films, we will seek to explore how the â€˜visor effectâ€™ and â€˜spectralityâ€™ inform the viewership of these works.</p>

                                      <p class="project_desc">Halfway through the eighth session of his seminars on capital punishment, Jacques Derrida decides to â€œpauseâ€ the seminar, performing perhaps the freeze-framing of his argument as if we, the readers of Death Penalty Volume I, or they, the listeners of the seminar at the time, were actually â€˜seeingâ€™ his words in visual form. Through this moment of paucity, Derrida projects his own speech as if it were an image onscreen and calls upon the readers and/or listeners to â€˜watchâ€™ what he is about to say, to perhaps imagine it as if they were pausing it on TV. He wants us to see the guillotine, this daughter of Dr. Guillotin, not only as a figure of speech but more importantly as a figure, a virtual representation, an allegory of a machine that is personified in the image of an old, toothless whore carrying out the instructions of her puppeteer, the pimp who manages her, the bourreau, the executioner. For Derrida, desanguinizing the death penalty does not signify an execution without blood, but a mere shift in its economic relations, as the blood we donâ€™t see is but consumed by the mechanism and then virtualized in the spectator's mind.</p>

For Jacques LaÃ§an, image is misunderstood at the â€˜mirror stageâ€™ when a reflection of our ideal selves is placed in diametric opposition to our actual physical body creating a fantasmatic superimposition that continues to govern our adult life. If we imbricate LaÃ§an with Ranciere, a mis-identification of self-perception must undergo a new â€œdistribution of the perceptibleâ€ in art to dislodge signifiers unto a prism of new signifieds. Hence, I want to propose a reading of FernÃ¡ndo Perezâ€™ retelling of Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s Vertigo in his 2007 film Madrigal in this light. The Cuban film redeploys the ultimate American narrative of phallocentric gaze struggling to exert power over an object of illusive femininity in new and polyvalent ways. Employing an oneiric logic, PÃ©rez engages his Cuban audience with a recurring dream that on the surface evokes a fractured psyche but perhaps is invoking that which hides beneath the images and stands in opposition to the cinematic, causing a political event: the thoughts that cannot be incorporated into revolutionary consciousness â€“ the thoughts that have no part. Can we view Madrigalâ€™s revision of Vertigo as a re-distribution of the perceptible - an aesthetically political act that incorporates new ways of perceiving in Cuba?</p>

                                      <p class="project_desc">Nelly Richardâ€™s chapter â€œRuptures, Memory and Discontinuitiesâ€ in The Insubordination of Signs describes the post-dictatorship scene in Chile as â€œsuturing the borders of a wound that separates punishment from forgivenessâ€ (Richard 13). With her book, Richard wants to place the hand of the reader over that roughness so he or she can feel the scar left behind by the sutured wound. Lucrecia Martel, in her 2008 Argentinean film La mujer sin cabeza, employs the visual equivalent of Richardâ€™s argument to force the spectator to imagine that which falls out of his or her peripheral vision â€“ the elusive evidence of its main characterâ€™s violence against an innocent member of the lower class through a hit and run accident.
                                          <br>
                                          <br>In Martelâ€™s seemingly inscrutable film, the main character VerÃ³nica initially feigns amnesia in an attempt to avoid the guilt from the crime she committed, but then she pretends to remember it so the men around her can cover it up, thus absolving her conscience. In juxtaposing Richardâ€™s fragmented and reactionary Chilean reality that post-dictatorship democracy smoothes out into passive cohesion with VerÃ³nicaâ€™s carefully orchestrated non-reactions and subsequent erasure of the cracks in her conscience, we see that Richardâ€™s critical lens and Martelâ€™s visual aesthetics seek to highlight the disruption, the myriad of irreconcilable pieces, beneath the passiveness of VerÃ³nica (and her class) and the insistence of post-dictatorship on a single narrative, on stitching together the traumatic wounds to erase its impact â€“ to forget. Martelâ€™s ironic framing and editing obscure key parts of the image and bind together loose fragments to artificially create an official story â€“ one that circumvents a violent secret but can easily fall apart at the seams.</p>

                                    <h3>THE VEILED SCREEN: UNCANNY CRYSTALLIZATIONS IN THE INTERMEDIAL ABYSS (THEORY)</h3>
                                    <h4>DISSERTATION AND FIRST BOOK</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="slide-content">
                                    <p>In an interview with Cashiers du cinema, Gilles Deleuze famously proclaimed that â€œthe brain is the screenâ€ and that â€œthe biology of the brainâ€ has more to offer to the connection between â€œspiritual lifeâ€ and film than psychoanalysis and linguistics as â€œcinema not only puts movement in the image, it puts movement in the mind.â€ By illustrating how the horror of the double in this medium symptomizes the mental repression of spectators contending with traumatic events under totalitarian regimes in Spain, Latin America and Eastern Europe, this book proposes we view cinema as an uncanny duplication of the workings of the brain â€“ a doppelgÃ¤nger to human thought.  Through this doubling, it can also generate a resistance in the viewer against his or her own constrictive condition, not only to liberate the body from its restrained physical state, but to unleash synaptic associations within the brain that cannot be controlled by outside forces as they remain impermeable to the state. Just as written signs prosthetically transmit thoughts from author to reader in a literary text to suggest to the reader an uncanny transcription of his or her own thinking, the brain acts as the double of the screen in motion as much as the screen seems to duplicate the brainâ€™s activities, a recursive mise-en-abyme in which the spectator falls into the abyss between thought and image.</p>
				   <p> The first chapter titled â€˜Confinement and Blindness: The Spectator Defies Its Spatial and Visual Limitsâ€™ begins by juxtaposing BuÃ±uel and DalÃ­â€™s use of objects and space in Un chien andalou to depict how institutional structures limit desire from its natural free-flowing irrational state within our subconscious with a theoretical reading of Carlos Sauraâ€™s understudied La madriguera (1969) to elucidate how the directorâ€™s comparable use of claustrophobic space unveils the mechanisms of censorship affecting the Spanish spectators of the 1960s. The chapter then focuses on the theme of reconstituted sight in Spanish films made at the end of the Franco dictatorship and under the subsequent democratic period as they echo the famous opening scene in Un chien andalou where BuÃ±uel sliced the eye of a woman with a razor. It revisits The Spirit of the Beehive (El espÃ­ritu de la colmena, Erice, 1973) and Raise Ravens (CrÃ­a cuervos, Saura, 1976) through the eyes of its two main characters named Ana and how they process the trauma of the violence removed from their sight through imagination and playacting. The Ana's imagined relationship to violence in both films are extrapolated to horror films from the democratic period that deal with the defiance of sight in a direct way, Bigas Luna's Anguish (1987) and Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's Thesis (Tesis, 1996). What we could not see in the first two films (both a circumvention of and commentary on Francoist censorship) becomes hypervisible in these films, signaling a resistance to looking away and a determination to confront and vanquish the trauma of Spain's brutal past. Finally, we examine how this evasion of sight plays in the Latin American context by examining Lucrecia Martelâ€™s La mujer sin cabeza (2008) as a film that prevents the spectator from seeing the horrors its title suggest, hence eviscerating their capacity to face its violence, as a representation of the nationâ€™s pervasive blindness to the disappearing bodies during the Junta years.</p>
	<p> The second chapter titled â€˜Consciousness, Spectrality and Duplication: The Spectator Falls Into the Cinematic Abyssâ€™ begins with a detailed critical exploration of Diego Velazquezâ€™ 1656 baroque painting Las meninas as prefiguring the prosthetic elements of cinema in its fusion of two perspectives into one stereoscopic vision, thus representing the very illusion of the three-dimensionality of human perception â€“ depth perceived by the brainâ€™s synthesis of what each eye sees individually. Launching of this duplication of consciousness as represented through spatial bilocation in the painting, this chapter goes on to theorize the presence of the film spectator as an invisible specter looking through a raised visor, not of an anachronistic armor but of the lens of a camera, unto a fictional vision of another time, perhaps a representation of the past or that of an imagined future, or, in Shakespearian terms, â€˜a time out of jointâ€™. The chapter then discusses Freudâ€™s â€˜The uncannyâ€™ in conjunction with Deleuzeâ€™s varying crystals from The Time-Image to build the idea that the film screen is a cinematic abyss on which the spectatorâ€™s thoughts are uncannily duplicated. Launching off this idea of an â€˜uncanny crystallization,â€™ the chapter then traverses through several examples to illustrate varying instances in which duality emerges within the diegesis to reflect the doubling of the spectatorâ€™s mental predicament as what is projected visually on the screen.</p>
	<p> The third chapter titled â€˜Horror and Delusion: The Quixotic Spectator Virtualizes a New Realityâ€™ first explores genre transformations in horror cinema through a close reading of how Quixotic techniques are echoed by contemporary filmmaker Wes Craven in his metafilmic reinvention of the horror genre with films such as Wes Cravenâ€™s New Nightmare (1994) and the Scream series (1996-2011). The comparison between Cervantes and Cravenâ€™s deployment of metafictive devices elucidates an active shift in consciousness about gender and narrative as they respectively unmask and repurpose the chivalric romance and the horror film, genres in which women have typically played a passive yet central role as damsels and victims. Through a comparison with the cave of Montesinos episode in Miguel de Cervantesâ€™ second volume of El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha, the chapter then theorizes the convergence of the oneiric with the metafilmic in films that are self-reflexive by taking place entirely in a virtual world its protagonistsâ€™ inhabit as if they were dreaming it.

				<p> My second book would entail a collaborative effort between neuroscience and cinema to answer questions about the creation and reception of audio-visual texts. My idea is to produce a contemporary self-reflexive horror film in line with the case studies theorized in my dissertation, a project I would write and direct while digitally documenting that creative process. Then, the film would be screened for a controlled audience while monitoring their neurobiological activity using functional brain imaging techniques. I predict that activity in brain regions involved in creativity will be hyperactive during specifically timed epochs in the horror film. These findings would test the predictions concluded by the humanistic research. This digital project and its findings would comprise a book split into two sections, one on the process of making the film and the other on the spectatorsâ€™ reception of it. The idea here is to create a scenario in which we are privy to the creative thoughts of the filmmaker as he conceives the film as well as those of the audience as they watch it. Therefore, through a mixture of neuroscientific and cinematic techniques, we can document empirically how that uncanny duplication theorized in my dissertation occurs.</p>
				<p> Taking Uri Hassonâ€™s field of â€˜neurocinematicsâ€™ a step further, my long-term research seeks to produce films to test specific hypotheses about how the brain processes creativity and subjectivity in order to illuminate the role of the horror spectator in various contexts such as the Iberian Peninsula, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Monitoring the brainâ€™s creative activity during an audio-visual screening becomes crucial in understanding precisely what kind of active role the cinematic can have in subject formation.</p>

                                    <p>	I'm working on a third book-length project exploring the thematic and structural links between Miguel de Cervantesâ€™ El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha, which metareferentially parodies chivalric romances, and David Lynchâ€™s seminal narrative television show Twin Peaks, itself an avant-garde parody of the American soap opera. Through a comparison of both texts, taking into account their distinctive socio-cultural and historical contexts, I will seek to elucidate how parody, self-reflection, and metafictional experimentation engender more complex forms of narrative.  I will argue that Twin Peaks is the blueprint for long format audiovisual narratives that can be viewed as executing the contemporary equivalent of narrative and character complexity as generated in the early development of the modern novel. In seeing Don Quixote as a popular self-reflexive product in its time, rather than the canonical text it came to be, and on the flipside by looking at Twin Peaks as the seed for current shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men, as well as for the popular act of binge-watching Netflix shows such as House of Cards whose episodes are released all at once, I want to formulate a theory for this new audio-visual form, these sixty-hour long series that work more like a novel than a TV show or feature film and are now being consumed not episodically but continuously, privately and at the viewers desired pace, not unlike picking up a book and reading chapter after chapter at leisure. Making broader links between Golden Age Spain and postmodern America, I also want to explore the role these seemingly incongruous national and historical contexts, four centuries apart, play in the transformations of narrative forms.</p>

                                            <p>Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Guillermo RodrÃ­guez-Romaguera published his first short story when he was twelve years old. He went on to pursue a degree in Comparative Literature from Princeton University and a master's degree in film production from the University of Southern California.</p>
                                            <p>At USC, he received the Harold Lloyd Foundation Scholarship and won The Caucus Foundation Student Filmmaker Award for his 35mm thesis Playing. Upon graduation, Guillermo wrote, produced and directed an emotional thriller entitled The Shadows and produced and edited the feature film Sweet Thing, a coming-of-age fairy tale set in urban Seattle. During this time, Guillermo also honed his skills as an editor, working as a promo editor for DirecTV, NBC and CBS as well as editing numerous feature films, documentaries and TV series.</p>
                                            <p>Now, after years of experience as a filmmaker and writer, Guillermo pursues a PhD in Comparative Media and Culture where his practical knowledge of the field and his passion for storytelling serve as tools to dissect fiction both in written and visual form.</p>
